extends Node3D
class_name EquipmentSystem

## A node that listens for signals from a player node to change equipment, or
## to activate and deactivate Area3D equipment nodes.
## When the 'change_signal" emits from the player node, the child #0 under
## the held_mount_point will reparent to the stored_mount_point, and same for
## child #0 of stored, will move to held. Handy for swaping objects from hand
## bones to back bones or similar.

## the Activate and deactivate signals will turn on and off monitoring for the 
## area3d children. Also if they hit things in the target_group they'll emit
## the hit_target signal, and if they hit anything else, they'll emit hit_world
## signal. Hitting target will communicate equipment and player_node info to the
## object receiving the hit.



## The node that will emit the weapon change signal
@export var player_node : CharacterBody3D
## The object group to detect 
@export var target_group : String = "targets"

## The signal name from player_node for when the item should be active.
## items themselves should manage what "active" means, but typically this is
## monitoring/collision shapes, emitters,sound FX, etc. 
@export var activate_signal : String = "attack_started"
## Signal to cancel if the collision monitoring of the held item.
@export var deactivate_signal : String = "hurt_started"
## The signal name should be connected to trigger the equipment swap
@export var change_signal : String = "weapon_changed"
## The primary item location. Bone attachments or Marker3Ds work well for placement
@export var held_mount_point : Node3D
## The secondary item location. Bone attachments or Marker3Ds work well for placement
@export var stored_mount_point : Node3D
## The item currently under the primary held mount node
@onready var current_equipment : EquipmentObject
## The item currently under the stored/sheathed node
